# Stock-Prediction
Stock prediction using LSTM
# Description
Predicting stock prices is a challenging and dynamic task. Our project focuses on using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to analyze historical stock data and make future price predictions.
# Key Features
1. LSTM Modeling: We implement LSTM neural networks using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.
2. Time Series Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is crucial for handling time series data. We cover techniques for data normalization, sequence generation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for training.
3. Evaluation Metrics: To assess the model's performance, we use various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing LSTM hyperparameters, including the number of layers, units, and training epochs, is essential for achieving accurate predictions.
5. Visualization: We visualize stock price predictions and actual values using interactive plots and charts.
